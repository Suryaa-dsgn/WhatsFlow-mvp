✅ Product Requirements Document (PRD) for WhatsFlow
________________


🛠️ 1. Site Overview
WhatsFlow is an AI-powered platform that enables businesses to create, customize, and deploy automated WhatsApp flows with ease. The platform combines conversational AI, drag-and-drop flow building, and real-time performance tracking into a seamless experience.
The site will consist of the following primary sections:
1. Landing Page:
 The entry point where users learn about WhatsFlow’s capabilities. It introduces the product’s value proposition, highlights its features, and includes clear call-to-actions (CTAs) to guide users towards creating their WhatsApp flows.

2. Conversational UI:
 Once users click on the CTA from the landing page, they are directed to the AI-powered conversational interface. Here, the AI interacts with users in a chat-style format to gather their requirements, goals, and preferences. This interaction helps the AI understand what type of WhatsApp flow the user needs for their business.

3. Playground:
 After the conversation, users are guided to the playground, which is the flow-building workspace. This section consists of:

   * Chat box (left side): The conversational interface continues to assist users with real-time flow adjustments and suggestions.
   * Flow builder (middle): A visual space where the auto-generated WhatsApp flow is displayed. Users can modify it using drag-and-drop functionality, adding or editing nodes, conditions, and branches.
   * Real-time preview (right side): A live simulation that shows how the flow will appear and behave for the end user. This lets businesses visualize customer interactions in real-time.
   4. Deployment:
 Once the flow is ready, users can instantly deploy it via the WhatsApp Business API.

   5. Dashboard:
 After deployment, users can monitor the performance of their flows through the dashboard. It provides key performance indicators (KPIs) such as message delivery rates, customer engagement, and conversions. The dashboard also includes A/B testing functionality, allowing users to compare multiple flow versions and choose the one that performs best.

Conversational AI Flow
When users click the "Create Your Flow" CTA, they are directed to the conversational interface.
            * The AI introduces itself and asks a series of natural, interactive questions to gather the necessary context.
            * Example conversation:
            * AI: "Hi! What kind of WhatsApp flow are you looking to create today? Customer support, sales, or something else?"
            * User: "Sales follow-up flow for my e-commerce store."
            * AI: "Got it! Do you want to include automated responses for abandoned carts or special discount offers?"
            * As the conversation progresses, the AI extracts the user's business needs, flow structure, and preferences.
At the end of the conversation, the AI presents a CTA like:
“Generate Your Flow”
 When users click this button, they are navigated to the playground section where the pre-generated flow is displayed.
Playground Flow
In the playground, users interact with a three-section layout:
            * Left Section (Chat Box):
 The chat box remains active, allowing the AI to provide real-time flow suggestions or guide users on how to modify specific steps.

            * Middle Section (Flow Builder):
 The AI-generated WhatsApp flow is displayed using React Flow.

               * Users can drag and drop nodes representing different actions, such as:
               * Message nodes (send text, image, video)
               * Condition nodes (if/else branches)
               * Delay nodes (wait X minutes/hours)
               * Users can rearrange, edit, or add new nodes as they see fit.
               * Right Section (Real-time Preview):
 Users can see how the flow behaves from a customer’s perspective.

                  * Example: If a customer selects a product category, the preview shows the automated message flow in real-time.
Flow Deployment and Tracking
After completing their flow, users can click “Deploy Flow”, which automatically integrates the flow with the WhatsApp Business API.
                  * Once deployed, users can view real-time analytics on the dashboard, including customer interactions, response rates, and overall performance.
                  * The dashboard offers A/B testing, allowing users to compare multiple flows side by side and choose the most effective one.
