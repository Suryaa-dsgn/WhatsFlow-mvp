🚀 WhatsFlow – App Flow Documentation
________________


✅ 1. Landing Page
The landing page is the first point of contact for users. It is designed to clearly communicate WhatsFlow’s value proposition and encourage users to get started.
When users arrive at the landing page, they will first see a hero section with a dark-themed, modern design that aligns with the brand’s visual identity. The hero section will contain:
* The WhatsFlow logo and name displayed prominently in large, bold text.
* A compelling tagline, such as: "Effortlessly Build and Automate Your WhatsApp Flows with AI."
* A CTA button labeled “Create Your Flow,” which will direct users to the AI-powered conversational interface.
As users scroll down, they will encounter the About Us section, where WhatsFlow explains its core purpose. This section will briefly describe:
* The problem being solved (the complexity of building WhatsApp flows).
* The AI-powered solution WhatsFlow offers (streamlined flow creation, real-time preview, and easy deployment).
* The benefits of using WhatsFlow, such as time savings, ease of customization, and improved customer interactions.
Further down, the Features section will showcase the key functionalities WhatsFlow offers. This will include:
* Auto-generated flows based on AI-driven conversations.
* Real-time preview capabilities.
* Drag-and-drop customization.
* One-click deployment with the WhatsApp Business API.
* Analytics and A/B testing for optimization.
At the bottom, there will be a footer containing essential links, such as:
* Privacy policy and terms of service.
* Contact details or support links.
* Social media handles or links to WhatsFlow’s online presence.
When users click on the CTA button in the hero section, they will be navigated to the conversational AI interface.

✅ 2. Conversational AI Interface
After clicking the CTA on the landing page, users will be directed to the conversational AI interface, where they will interact with the AI assistant. This interface will have a simple and clean chat layout, making the conversation feel natural and intuitive.
The AI will greet the user with a message such as:
* “Hello! 👋 Let’s create a WhatsApp flow tailored for your business. I’ll ask you a few quick questions to understand your needs.”
The AI will then ask structured questions to gather context.
For example:
* "What is the purpose of your WhatsApp flow?" (Customer support, sales, lead generation, etc.)
* "Do you want automated replies for FAQs or custom message triggers?"
* "Would you like to include conditions like if/else or time delays?"
* "Do you have a preferred message tone or style?"
The AI will dynamically adjust the conversation based on the user’s responses, making it feel interactive and personalized.
As the conversation progresses, the AI will silently build the flow logic in the background, mapping out the WhatsApp flow based on the user’s inputs.
At the end of the conversation, the AI will display a CTA button that says:
* “Generate My Flow” or “Go to Flow Builder.”
When the user clicks this button, they will be navigated to the playground section, where their WhatsApp flow will be displayed.

✅ 3. Playground Section
After completing the AI conversation, the user is directed to the playground, which is the core workspace for flow customization.
The playground consists of three sections arranged side by side:
* Left section: The chat box.
* Middle section: The flow builder (React Flow workspace).
* Right section: The real-time preview.
Upon entering the playground, users will see a pre-generated WhatsApp flow created by the AI, based on the context gathered during the conversation.
In the left section, the chat box allows users to:
* Ask the AI for modifications or suggestions.
* Make quick edits by interacting with the AI, such as:
   * “Add a message asking for the customer’s email.”
   * “Include a delay before sending the confirmation message.”
The middle section is the visual flow builder, where users can:
* Drag and drop nodes to customize the flow.
* Add, delete, or rearrange message, condition, and delay nodes.
* Connect nodes to form branching paths, enabling advanced flow logic.
* Rename and label nodes for clarity.
The right section shows the real-time preview of the WhatsApp flow.
As the user makes changes in the builder, the preview dynamically updates.
The preview displays:
* The sequence of messages.
* Conditional branches.
* The exact customer experience in a simulated chat interface.
Once the user is satisfied with the flow, they can click the “Deploy” button to push the flow live through the WhatsApp Business API.

✅ 4. Deployment Flow
When the user clicks the “Deploy” button, WhatsFlow will:
* Automatically connect to the WhatsApp Business API.
* Deploy the flow, making it live for customer interactions.
* Display a confirmation message:
   * “Your WhatsApp flow has been successfully deployed! 🚀”
* Users will also have the option to edit and re-deploy the flow later if needed.
________________


✅ 5. Dashboard and Analytics
After deployment, users can access the dashboard, which provides insights into their WhatsApp flow’s performance.
Upon visiting the dashboard, users will see:
* Overall performance metrics, including:
   * Message delivery rate.
   * Open rate.
   * Customer engagement (response rate).
   * Lead conversion metrics.
The dashboard will include data visualizations such as:
* Line charts showing engagement trends over time.
* Pie charts breaking down message interactions.
The A/B testing section will allow users to:
* Compare the performance of different versions of their flows.
* Choose the best-performing flow.
* See detailed metrics for each version side by side.
Users can switch between flows and analyze their impact using clear, interactive graphs and KPI displays.
